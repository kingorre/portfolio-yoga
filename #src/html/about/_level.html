            This class is designed for first time yogis. It's the right class for you if you want to learn the fundamentals of yoga in a group where everyone is new. The teacher will give you some background on yoga while you're seated, but come prepared to move. You’ll walk out feeling embodied, empowered, energized, and eager to come back.
